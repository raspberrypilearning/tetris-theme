## Introduction

In this project you will learn how to program musical notes in Sonic Pi so that you can turn sheet music into code. You'll create your own mix of the Tetris theme tune.

Tetris is a popular computer game created in 1984 by Russian coder Alexey Pajitnov. Many versions of Tetris use the music 'Korobeiniki', a Russian folk dance.

If you're using a Raspberry Pi computer then you can hear the music by playing the Tetromino game. You can find it by choosing 'Games' from the menu and then 'Python Games'. Don't play for too long! You've got coding to do.

The shapes of the Tetris pieces are called tetrominoes - the 2D shapes that can be made with 4 squares.

## Learning Objectives
+ Programming music using letter names.  
+ Using `play_pattern_timed` in Sonic Pi.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges
+ "Finish the tune" - Program more music from annotated musical notation.
+ "Mix the tune" - Experiment with using different synths.
+ "More of the tune" - Program more music from annotated musical notation and using `:r` for rests.
+ "More music" - Find simple sheet music online and program it.
